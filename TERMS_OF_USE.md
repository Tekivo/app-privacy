# Privacy Policy for Prayer Time Reminders

**Effective Date:** August 26, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Prayer Time Reminders" Alexa skill ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information when you use our skill. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.

## 1. Information We Collect

To provide you with accurate prayer times, our skill requires permission to access your device's location information through the Alexa Device Address API. The specific information we collect is:

* **Country and Postal Code:** We use this information solely to calculate the correct prayer timings for your location.

We do **not** collect any other personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, or specific street address.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

Your country and postal code are used for the following purposes:

* To make a one-time request to a third-party API (`api.aladhan.com`) to retrieve daily prayer schedules.
* To set reminders for Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha using the Alexa Reminders API.

## 3. Information Sharing and Disclosure

We share your country and postal code with the following third-party service to fulfill the core function of the skill:

* **Aladhan API (`api.aladhan.com`):** This service calculates prayer timings based on the location data we send. We do not control their data practices, and we recommend you review their privacy policy.

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to any other outside parties.

## 4. Data Retention

Our skill is designed to be stateless. We do **not** store your country or postal code on any servers or databases we control. The information is used only for the duration of the request to fetch prayer times and set reminders, after which it is discarded. The reminders themselves are stored in your Amazon account and are managed by Amazon's Alexa service.

## 5. Children's Privacy

This skill is not intended for or directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
